My name is Paul Bird, if you hadn't guessed I'm a Front-End Developer. My skills vary. I first mainly designed for the web but soon learned to love front end development even more so.

As it's progressed I've gained skills in making __Wordpress__ themes. I use __sass__ as my css preprocessor of choice. I use __Git__ to version control my work and I ocassionally use __gulp__ as my task runner of choice. Currently I am hard at work writing and building my final year project. My favourite language and framework of choice is __Javascript__ and __Nodejs__.

I'm currently interested in getting more into javascript frameworks. I've dabbled in __Angularjs__ and __Reactjs__ is on my list of things to learn. I also enjoy a well written REST API.

If you think I'm suited for a job for you then please [shoot me an email](mailto:paulbird1993@gmail.com) and we'll see how it goes.

My name is Paul Bird, if you hadn't guessed I'm a Front-End Developer. My skills vary. I first mainly designed for the web but soon learned to love front end development even more so.

As it's progressed I've gained skills in making __Wordpress__ themes. I use __sass__ as my css preprocessor of choice. I use __Git__ to version control my work and I use __gulp__ as my task runner of choice and __Webpack__ as my build tool. Currently I am hard at work building websites for the clients of Thinking Juice. My favourite language is __Javascript__ and __Nodejs__ is my favourite for quick builds and writing APIs.

I'm currently interested in getting more into javascript frameworks and better at javascript in general. I've dabbled in __Reactjs__ but my go to javascript view library is currently __Vue__.

If you think I'm suited for a job for you then please [shoot me an email](mailto:paulbird1993@gmail.com) and we'll see how it goes.
